Biochemistry

DNA vs RNA
    deoxygenated at the 2' position
    thymine vs uracil
    rna autocleaves and is unstable
        stops synthesis
        
    cytosine
        spontaneously deaminates into uracil
            gets repaired
                if not, mutation
                    gets paired with A
                    goes from GC to AT
    ribosymes
        cleaves nucleic acid
    tRNA 
        translational RNA
        reads mRNA and translates it
        
    RNA and DNA might not pair the way we predict
 
Genomics
     coding region
         
     promoter region
         trascription factor binding sites
         
     exon shuffling
         new combo from introns from neighboring genes through replication
             generates two new genes
     alternative splicing
         when we cut out the introns
             makes new combos of exons together
                 results in different proteins
                 
     mutations
         snp: single nucleotide polymorphisms
             one mutation
                 deletion, insertion, swap
                     frameshift
         str: short tandem repeats
             deletions and insertions in the genome
         vntr: variable number tandem repeats
             repeats of a core sequence
             can be used in a forensic applications
                 only hair root has dna
     
     precision medicine
     
     plasmids
         self replicating pieces of DNA
         can carry genetic info thats not in chromosomal DNA
         found in pro and eukaryotic organisms
         
     cDNA: complementary DNA 
         generated from mRNA by reverse trascroptase
             goes from RNA to DNA
             
     high throughput DNA sequencing
         uses ddNTPs (dideoxynucleoside triphosphates)
         generates chain termination DNA molecules
         uses fluorescently labeled ddNTPs
         followed by capillary gel electrophoresis
     
     Sanger
         need:
             enzyme dna polymerase
             primer, small peice of dna
             nucleotides
         some wont incorporate any fluorescent nucleotides
         eventually you get a nucleotide thats dd at every position
         stops continuation of growth because they do it through the 3' OH
             which is removed
     
     PCR
         increases 2^n each cycle
         

    next gen sequencing
        rna to cdna
        amplify with pcr
        sequence the cdna
        compare sequences to the genome for what you're growing
        no bias or limits
        
    crispr-cas9
        clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats
        
        


use a BAA table when you don't only have HA
    like when you're adding NaOH to find a new pH

CHAPTER 5

cell fragmentation
    cells are broken open by:
        sonication
        shearing
        incubation with mild detergent
    then we centrifuge
        depending on how fast/long you spin, you can separate different fractions or masses
        
    au is moles per time
    


Column chromatography

    gel filtration/size exclusion
        beads make large proteins travel faster becuase they dont get stuck in the pores
    
        HPLC: high pressure liquid chromatography
        
    ion exchange
        opposite charge elutes last
        cation exchange has negative beads
            cations exchange for another cation
        anion exchange has positive beads to catch anions
                    
                        size    pI

                buffer with pH 5 what order in anion exchange chromatography?
                    beads have positive charge
                    
                    pH 5 means A is negative, B is positive, C is more positive
                    
                    answer: C elutes first because its least attracted to the positive beads
                    
    affinity 
        lactate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to lactase
            uses nadh

    polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
    cathode (-) to anode (+) travel direction
    
    small proteins migrate further than large ones
    
    SDS-PAGE
        protein is coated in sds (-)
        
        % polyacrilamide
            low % means looser weave
                small go through easily
                good for big things
            high % is good at separating small proteins

isoelectric focusing
    separates proteins based on pI
    
    low pH close to positive terminal
    high pH close to negative terminal
    
    higher pI migrate towards negative terminal (high pH)
    lower pI migrate towards positive terminal (low pH)
    
    they stop at pH == pI
